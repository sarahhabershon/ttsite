Have written a js media query to display all content on mobile but only one page at a time on desktop or tablet. Still need to enable the links on mobile to direct user to the part of the page where the content is.

TRY USING SPAN TAGS
text alignment is the problem


Still need an intermediate media screen size background image for jumbotron

Also revise jumbotron sizing, try using 50% height perhaps? Try to get it to take up half the screen on mobile?

bootstrap break points are:


    /*==========  Mobile First Method  ==========*/

    /* Custom, iPhone Retina */
    @media only screen and (min-width : 320px) {

    }

    /* Extra Small Devices, Phones */
    @media only screen and (min-width : 480px) {

    }

    /* Small Devices, Tablets */
    @media only screen and (min-width : 768px) {

    }

    /* Medium Devices, Desktops */
    @media only screen and (min-width : 992px) {

    }

    /* Large Devices, Wide Screens */
    @media only screen and (min-width : 1200px) {

    }


To do list:

sort out alignment of text at different screen widths
make centred text look pretty
standardise the breakpoints for responsiveness
resize profile photo for mobile; can it be in ems instead of pixels?
write copy for about and commission
organise final images
sus domain name and hosting on github
put fb and ig links in navbar
